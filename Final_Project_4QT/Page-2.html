	    <h2>How can we Achieve these Targets?</h2>
	    <p>Ensuring healthy lives for all requires a strong commitment, but the benefits outweigh the cost. Healthy people are the foundation for healthy economies. Countries worldwide are urged to take immediate and decisive actions to predict and counteract health challenges. This becomes especially critical in safeguarding vulnerable population groups and individuals residing in regions burdened by high disease prevalence. By doing so, we can strengthen health systems and foster resilience in the face of health adversities. Immunization is one of the world’s most successful and cost-effective health interventions. However, the alarming decline in childhood vaccination – the largest sustained decline in childhood vaccinations in approximately 30 years – is leaving millions of children at risk from devastating but preventable diseases.</p>

	    <h2>Does everyone have access to healthcare?</h2>
	    <p>The goal of universal health coverage, or UHC, is to guarantee that no one is denied access to high-quality medical care because of their financial situation. Between 2000 and 2015, efforts to combat infectious diseases like HIV, TB, and malaria resulted in notable increases in service coverage; however, since then, progress has slowed. One major obstacle to UHC remains to be inequality. Those who are wealthier, better educated, and reside in cities are more likely to have access to reproductive, maternal, child, and adolescent health services, particularly in low-income nations.</p>

	    <h2>What can I do to help?</h2>
	    <p>You can begin by making educated decisions, engaging in safe sexual behavior, immunizing your kids, and promoting and safeguarding the health of those in your immediate vicinity. You can educate people in your community about the value of leading a healthy lifestyle and advocating for people's rights to high-quality healthcare, particularly for the most vulnerable groups like women and children. Additionally, you have the power to hold your government, local authorities, and other decision-makers responsible for keeping their promises to expand public health and healthcare access.</p>
