	    <p>Global health progress has been made in recent years,

		progress has been made in reducing maternal mortality and 
		expanding universal health coverage. The COVID-19 pandemic 
		and ongoing crises have impeded progress towards Goal 3. 
		Increased investment in health systems is needed to support

	    <p>Health improvements have been made in recent years, with 
		146 out of 200 countries meeting or on track to meet the 
		Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target on under-5 mortality. 
		However, inequalities in healthcare access persist, and the 
		COVID-19 pandemic has impeded progress towards Goal 3. To 
		address these issues, increased investment in health systems

	    <h2>Accessing Essential Health Services</h2>
	    <p>Many people around the world still do not have access to 
		essential healthcare services. It is imperative to address 
		discrepancies in order to close this gap and guarantee equitable 
		access to healthcare. To achieve the Sustainable Development 
		Goal goals and our shared goal of Health for All, we must address 
		a number of health determinants, such as environmental and commercial 
		factors.</p>
